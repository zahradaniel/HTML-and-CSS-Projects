    <p>HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.
        Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether.
        A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
    </p>
    </h2>
    <p>What are Tags and Attributes?
        Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets.
            Most tags must be opened and closed in order to function.
            Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.
    </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="Rules_To_Remember" class="main-section">
    <header>Rules To Remember</header>
    <p>The vast majority of tags must be opened (tag) and closed (tag) with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags.
        When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened. 
        </p>
    
    </section>
    
    <section id="Creating_Your_First_HTML_Webpage" class="main-section">
    <header>Creating Your First HTML Webpage</header>
    <p>These tags should be placed underneath each other at the top of every HTML page that you create.
        !DOCTYPE html — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.
        html — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.
        head — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.
        body — This is where the content of the page goes.
        </p>
    
    <p>Further Tags
        Inside the (head) tag, there is one tag that is always included: (title), but there are others that are just as important:
        (title)
        This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at the top of the browser window or tab.
        (meta)
        This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name (page context), description.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="Adding_Content" class="main-section">
        <header>Adding Content</header>
    <p>The HTML (body) is where we add the content which is designed for viewing by human eyes.
        This includes text, images, tables, forms and everything else that we see on the internet each day.
        </p>
    
    <p>As you might have guessed (h1) and (h2) should be used for the most important titles, while the remaining tags should be used for sub-headings and less important text.
        Search engine bots use this order when deciphering which information is most important on a page.
        </p>

    <section id="How_To_Add_Text_In_HTML" class="main-section">
    <header>How To Add Text In HTML</header>
    <p>Adding text to our HTML page is simple using an element opened with the tag (p) which creates a new paragraph. We place all of our regular text inside the element (p).
    </p>
    
    <p>How To Add Links In HTML
        As you may have noticed, the internet is made up of lots of links.
        Almost everything you click on while surfing the web is a link takes you to another page within the website you are visiting or to an external site.
        Links are included in an attribute opened by the (a) tag. This element is the first that we’ve met which uses an attribute and so it looks different to previously mentioned tags.

     <section id="Creating_An_Anchor_Tag" class="main-section">
        <header>Creating An Anchor Tag</header>
        <p>
           To create an anchor tag you must create an anchor element with an href which will link your website.
        </p>
        <p>
            If everything is correct then you will see a link which will take you to your second page. On the second page, there will be a link that will take you to the link you provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first part of the attribute points to the page that will open once the link is clicked. Meanwhile the second part of the attribute contains the text which will be displayed to a visitor in order to entice them to click on that link.
